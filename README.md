# Hot-Server
This is a simple framework for hosting agents that can migrate from one server and port, to another server and port. For the example, the server is always localhost, but the code would work the same on different, and multiple, hosts.  State is implemented simply as an integer that is incremented. This represents the state of some arbitrary conversation.
